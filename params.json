{"name":"Trapped","tagline":"","body":"### You Are **Trapped**\r\nA vicious monster is on the loose. It’s fast, it’s scary, and...it’s cloaked! Players must work together to get through this thrilling chase by updating each other on the monster’s current position. It reveals itself from time to time or when it’s about to snatch another poor soul. Spectators (newcomers and players who have been caught by the monster) have a full view of the map, the players, and the monster. Will they use this knowledge for good and aid their fellow hunted or will they lead them into a lethal trap?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nDesigned for the Global Game Jam 2015\r\n\r\nDesigners: Erick Witting, Keiran Lovett, Mark Christian Calugay\r\nTechnicals: Richard Kim, Justice Kayiwa, Christie Yung, Brian Tsui, Andrew Yip, Newton Isaac, Raymond Kim\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Vision\r\nA simple game that engages users through thrilling situations and thought provoking cooperation and/or competition.\r\n\r\n###Genre\r\nFirst person shooter type game but removing the shooter aspect. Apply puzzle and arcade like elements. \r\n\r\n### Additional\r\nThe game is meant to be thrilling, not scary as is typical in horror games.\r\nUse visual and audible stimuli to keep players on their toes!\r\ne.g. they may hear sounds that sound similar to the monster jump-scare decoys are built into walls that pop out when a player gets close or pipes suddenly release bursts of steam don’t abuse this or it will lose its effect.\r\n\r\nThe game has two music states\r\nNormal track - a player is not being actively chased by the monster\r\nIntense track - a player is the currently the monster’s quarry\r\n\r\n1  Pace : This game play suggests the speed will be very quickly. The three minute interval between levels suggest that the size of the map will be fairly small but enough space that the monster can roam and lose sight of players. It should also not be too large as it would be too easy for players to just roam around aimlessly without having to worry about being caught by the monster\r\n\r\n2  Rewards : Every level a player survives adds points to their game. If a player is caught and goes into spectator mode they are not awarded any points at all. \r\n\r\n3 Game play Loop : the loop begins when players are randomly spawned into the game. The timer instantiates when all players are in the game world. The timer counts down until it reaches a point of no continuation (zero). All players have to play a little guessing game and find out who can last until the end. The game is designed so that players will be caught by the monster, but the ‘when’ plays a big part in creating anxiety and thrill. Once the timer reaches zero, all the players, both active and dead are then placed in a leaderboard in terms of who didn’t get caught and those got caught at what time. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
